Given an array arr of n integers, task is to print the array in the order â€“ smallest number, largest number, 2nd smallest number, 2nd largest number, 3rd smallest number, 3rd largest number and so on.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 9
arr[] = {1, 9, 2, 8, 3, 7, 4, 6, 5}
Output:
1 9 2 8 3 7 4 6 5
Explanation:
Smallest number is 1. Largest number is 9. 
2nd smallest number is 2. Then 2nd largest
number is 8. And so on.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 4
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}
Output:
1 4 2 3
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function rearrangeArray() which takes the array of integers arr and n as parameters and returns void. You need to change the array itself.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n*logn)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

solution:
class Solution{
  public:
    void rearrangeArray(int arr[], int n) {
        // code here
        sort(arr,arr+n);
        int i=0,j=n-1,temp[n],k=0;
        while(i<=j)
        {
            
            temp[k]=arr[i];
            k++;
            temp[k]=arr[j];
            i++;
            j--;
            k++;
            
        }
        for(k=0;k<n;k++)
        {
            arr[k]=temp[k];
        }
        
        
    }
};
