The two countries of A and B are at war against each other. Both countries have N number of soldiers. The power of these soldiers are given by A[i]...A[N] and B[i]....B[N].
These soldiers have a peculiarity. They can only attack their counterpart enemies, like A[i] can attack only B[i] and not anyone else. A soldier with higher power can kill the enemy soldier. If both soldiers have the same power, they both die. You need to find the winner country.

Example 1:

â€‹Input : a[ ] = {2, 2}, b[ ] = {5, 5}
Output : B
Explanation:
Both countries have 2 soldiers.
B[0] kills A[0], B[1] kills A[1]. 
A has 0 soldiers alive at the end. 
B has both soldiers alive at the end.
Return "B" as a winner.

â€‹Example 2:

Input : a[ ] = {9}, b[ ] = {8}  
Output :  A


Your Task:
This is a function problem. The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function Country_at_war() that takes an array (a), another array (b), sizeOfArray (n), and return the string "A" if A is the winner, "B" if B is the winner and "DRAW" if it draws. The driver code takes care of the printing.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
solution:

string Country_at_war(int a[], int b[], int n)
{
    // Complete the function
    int i,flag1=0,flag2=0;
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        if(a[i]>b[i])
        {
           flag1++;
        }
        if(b[i]>a[i])
        {
            flag2++;
        }
        
    }
    if(flag1>flag2)
    {
        return "A";
    }
    if(flag2>flag1)
    {
        return "B";
    }
    if(flag1==flag2)
    {
        return "DRAW";
    }
  
 
}
