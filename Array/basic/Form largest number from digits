Given an array of numbers form 0 to 9 of size N. Your task is to rearrange elements of the array such that after combining all the elements of the array number formed is maximum.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
A[] = {9, 0, 1, 3, 0}
Output:
93100
Explanation:
Largest number is 93100 which
can be formed from array digits.
 

Example 2:

Input:
N = 3
A[] = {1, 2, 3}
Output:
321
 

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function MaxNumber() which takes the array A[] and its size N as inputs and returns a single line a string denoting the largest number that can be achieved by rearranging the elements of the array.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

            for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
                h[arr[i]]++;
            }
        
            for(int i=9;i>=0;i--){
                while(h[i]-- > 0){
                    s+= (char) ('0' + i);
                }
            }
            return s;
        }
};
