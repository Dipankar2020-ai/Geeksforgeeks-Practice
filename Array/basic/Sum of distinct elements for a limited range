Given an array, arr[] of N elements such that every element of the array is an integer in the range 1 to n, the task is to find the sum of all the distinct elements of the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: N = 9
arr[] = {5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 3, 6, 7}
Output: 28
Explanation: The distinct elements in 
the array are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
Example 2:

Input: N = 3, arr[] = {1, 1, 1}
Output: 1

Your Task:
This is a function problem. You don't need to take any input, as it is already accomplished by the driver code. You just need to complete the function sumOfDistinct() that takes array arr[]  and integer N as parameters and returns the sum of a distinct elements of the array.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

 

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 106

solution:
class Solution{
	
	
	public:
	int sumOfDistinct(int arr[], int n) 
	{ 
	    // Your code goes here
	    int sum = 0;
 
    // Hash to store all element of array
    unordered_set< int > s;
    for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
    {
        if (s.find(arr[i]) == s.end())
        {
            sum += arr[i];
            s.insert(arr[i]);
        }
    }
 
    return sum;
	} 
		 

};
