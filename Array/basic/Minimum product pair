Given an array of positive integers. The task is to print the minimum product of any two numbers of the given array.

 

Example 1:

Input : 
n = 4
arr[] = {2, 7, 3, 4}
Output :
6
Explanation : 
The minimum product of any
two numbers will be 2 * 3 = 25.
 

Example 2:

Input : 
n = 6
arr[] = {198, 76, 544, 123, 154, 675}
Output :  
7448
Explanation : 
The minimum product of any
two numbers will be 76 * 123 = 7448.
 

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function printMinimumProduct() which takes the array A[] and its size N as inputs and returns the minimum product of two numbers

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

solution:
class Solution{
  public:
    long long int printMinimumProduct(int arr[], int n) {
        
        sort(arr,arr+n);
        long long int ans=1,i;
        for(i=0;i<=1;i++)
        {
            ans*=arr[i];
        }
       
      
      return ans;
       
    }
};
